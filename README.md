# cpp_ulam_sequence_io_loop
The Ulam Sequence Program (C++) uses a loop to ask the user to enter an integer that is greater than or equal to 2. If the user enters valid input, the Ulam Sequence is processed as output, using the user input as the first integer of the sequence. Otherwise, the loop continues until the user enters valid input.
